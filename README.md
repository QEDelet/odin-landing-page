Hello, this is QEDelet constructing a landing page for the Odin Project curriculum. This time around, the bulk of the work consisted of using flexbox and CSS rules to format the page correctly, and while I've had trouble due to my browser not displaying the typefaces that I was shown in the sample image, I think I've got it lined up about as well as I can expect for now.
For personal reasons relating to events that occurred over the tail end of 2021, I didn't push the project as soon as I had it done, and I've only now returned to coding after a lengthy break. Due to a command line mishap, I accidentally overwrote the original index.html file and had to rewrite it from scratch, but doing so took me only an hour or two and it turned out to be a welcome chance to review the basics and shake off some of the rust.
I was presented with the option of retooling this page around a theme of my choice and possibly adding (appropriately licensed) images to it, but I think for now I'm happy with what I've got. I may come back later and personalize it further, though.
